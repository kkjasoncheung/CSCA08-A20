    Test case name:
    Text copied from automarker:

___ The report indicates that my code has invalid byte error(s). (Penalty applied) *
    Note: This option has 10% automarking deduction per correction, up to 20% deduction in total (no correction limit).

___ I used some data types that are restricted from the handout (and Piazza). (Penalty applied) *
    Note: This option has 50% automarking deduction.
        If none of the options above solve the issue, then use this option.


___ Others. (To be discussed with the instructor, penalty may apply) *
    Briefly describe your issue:
    Your possible solution:


*   If you request to re-run automarker, we will take the second result as the final automarking mark.
    Namely, we do not take the maximum, and your new automarking grade (and deduction) might be lower than original grade.
**  You may select multiple options, the deduction will be calculated separately. Make your decision wisely.
